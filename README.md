# Poker Win Simulator


In poker and finance alike, outcomes are driven by uncertainty. Rather than calculating a closed-form probability (which becomes nearly impossible once multiple unknowns are involved), we use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate win probability through randomized sampling.

This approach runs N simulations (usually 1,000â€“10,000) where unknown cards are drawn, and hand strength is evaluated each time.
